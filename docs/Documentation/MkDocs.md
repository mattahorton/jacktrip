# Write Documentation

This documentation of JackTrip is generated with [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). All pages are derived from Markdown files in the subdirectory `docs`
in JackTrip's git repository. Setup and table of contents is found in a YAML file called mkdocs.yml in
the root directory.

If you only want to edit a page you can click on the pen symbol at the top of each page.
