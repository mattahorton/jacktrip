# Write Documentation

This documentation of JackTrip is generated with [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). All pages are derived from Markdown files in the subdirectory `docs`
in JackTrip's git repository. Setup and table of contents is found in a YAML file called mkdocs.yml in
the root directory.

If you only want to edit a page you can click on the pen symbol at the top of each page.

## Run MkDocs on Your System

MkDocs and Material for MkDocs are installed from pip:
```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
``` 

When writing documentation it is very handy to run `mkdocs serve'. This will open
a local webserver (usually at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)).
If you change Markdown files of the documentation and save them, the website automatically
updates.
